# ScrapBridge
I developed *Scrap Bridge*, an advanced waste management platform that connects users with scrap collectors, I built the **login/signup system**, allowing users and collectors to authenticate securely.  

To enhance efficiency, I integrated a **deep learning-based CNN model** to classify different types of scrap automatically. I also implemented the **scrap pickup request system**, where users can submit requests, and collectors can accept or reject them. Additionally, I developed a **real-time notification system** to keep users informed about request status updates.  

The platform was structured using **Django for the backend**, a **responsive frontend**, and a **database** for storing user and request data. Through continuous testing and optimization, I ensured high accuracy in scrap classification and smooth request handling, making *Scrap Bridge* a reliable and scalable solution for waste management.
